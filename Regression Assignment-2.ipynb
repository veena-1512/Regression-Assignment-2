    "R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure used to assess the goodness of fit of a linear regression model. It provides insight into how well the independent variable(s) in the model explain the variability of the dependent variable. In other words, R-squared quantifies the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s) in the model.\n",

    "R-squared values fall between 0 and 1, and their interpretation depends on the context. Higher R-squared values indicate that a larger proportion of the variability in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable(s) in the model, suggesting a better fit. However, a high R-squared doesn't necessarily mean the model is a good fit for predicting new data points. It's possible to have an overfit model with a high R-squared that doesn't generalize well to unseen data.\n",

    "Regularized linear models are techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning by adding a penalty term to the linear regression cost function. The penalty term discourages the model from fitting the training data too closely and helps to create models that generalize better to new, unseen data. This is particularly useful when dealing with complex datasets with a large number of features or when the training dataset is relatively small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two commonly used regularized linear regression techniques are Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression. Both methods add a regularization term to the cost function, but they use different types of penalty terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ridge Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Ridge Regression, a regularization term is added to the linear regression cost function, which is the sum of squared coefficients (wj)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost function=MSE (Mean Squared Error)+λ∑^p j=1p​w^j2\n",
    "\n",
    "Where, p is the number of features, and λ is the regularization parameter that controls the strength of the penalty term. Ridge Regression shrinks the coefficients towards zero without forcing them to become exactly zero. This helps in reducing the impact of irrelevant or less important features on the model's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Lasso Regression:\n",
    "In Lasso Regression, a different type of regularization term is added to the cost function, which is the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost function=MSE (Mean Squared Error)+λ∑^p j=1p|wj|\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression not only shrinks the coefficients but also encourages some coefficients to become exactly zero. This leads to feature selection, where the model automatically chooses a subset of the most relevant features and discards the rest. Lasso is particularly useful when you suspect that many features are irrelevant or redundant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example where we're trying to predict house prices based on various features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. We have a dataset with a relatively small number of samples and a large number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without regularization, a linear model might fit the training data very closely, capturing all the noise and fluctuations in the data. This can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying Ridge or Lasso regularization, we introduce a penalty term that discourages the model from relying heavily on each individual feature. For instance, in Lasso Regression, some coefficients may become exactly zero, indicating that the corresponding features are not contributing significantly to the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of house price prediction, Ridge Regression might help in creating a smoother model that is less sensitive to small variations in features, preventing it from fitting the noise in the training data. Lasso Regression, on the other hand, might identify that only a subset of features (e.g., square footage and location) are truly important for predicting house prices, while other features (e.g., number of bathrooms) have minimal impact and can be effectively ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, regularized linear models strike a balance between fitting the training data and avoiding overfitting, leading to better generalization performance on unseen data.\n",

    "Limitation: While Lasso can perform feature selection by setting some coefficients to exactly zero, Ridge and Elastic Net tend to shrink coefficients toward zero, but they rarely achieve exact feature selection.\n",
    "Solution: If feature selection is a primary concern, Lasso is a better choice. Alternatively, you can use tree-based methods that naturally perform feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lack of Interpretability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitation: Regularized linear models can make the interpretation of individual coefficient values less straightforward, especially when coefficients are shrunk towards zero.\n",

    "\n",
    "Sensitivity to Hyperparameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitation: Regularized linear models have hyperparameters (e.g., alpha in Ridge and Lasso, and the mixing parameter in Elastic Net) that need to be tuned. The performance of these models can be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters.\n",

    "Solution: Techniques like dimensionality reduction (e.g., Principal Component Analysis) or specialized regression methods for high-dimensional data (e.g., lasso with coordinate descent) might be more appropriate.\n",
